## TerraMind Demo

### Ice

Dataset: https://data.dtu.dk/collections/AI4Arctic_Sea_Ice_Challenge_Dataset/6244065

Based on Sentinel-1 and MWR. Any possible to combine ??

Idea: Predict sea ice type

- Separate models for SIC, SOD, FLOE
- SIC could also be considered a pixel-wise regression task
- Explore thinking in modalities

Comparison

1. Terramind with fine tuning
2. Terramind with thinking in modalities
3. Training U-Net from scratch
